> **note**: If you're facing any deprecation issues, consider cloning and installing the DeepFace repository directly from GitHub, and then importing the functions from the local source. You can find the official repository here: [github.com/serengil/deepface](https://github.com/serengil/deepface)

# Face-Recognition
This repository contains a comprehensive face recognition system that combines YOLOv8 for face detection and FaceNet for face recognition. Face recognition is a critical technology with applications in security, surveillance, and user authentication. This project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models to achieve accurate and reliable face recognition.

- Detect faces in images using YOLO.
- Crop and save the detected faces.
- Recognize faces using DeepFace and categorize them based on a pre-trained model.
- Do whatever you feel like from the features extracted.

## Demo
Experience the functionality of our face recognition model, which has been trained on a dataset featuring faces of few politicians, by visiting [Live Demo](https://face-recognition-ml.streamlit.app/). Please keep in mind that this deployment is specifically designed for demonstration purposes and may not be fine-tuned for optimal performance in real-world scenarios. The best place to start and learn about the project's evolution is the ["o-testing"](https://github.com/sOR-o/Face-Recognition/tree/main/o-testing) folder. Here, you'll find different levels of understanding, providing comprehensive insights into the project's development.

  ## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sOR-o/Face-Recognition.git
cd Face-Recognition

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install deepface
pip install -e .

# Ready to go!
```

-Can be improved by transfer learning (obviously ðŸ˜‰)
